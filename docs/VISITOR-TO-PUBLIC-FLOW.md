## Visitor Wallet Connection Flow

### Before (WRONG ‚ùå)
```
Visitor connects wallet
  ‚Üí Create anonymous auth user
  ‚Üí Create public_users profile in DB
  ‚Üí Store wallet in DB
  ‚Üí ERROR: Missing updated_at column
```

### After (CORRECT ‚úÖ)
```
Visitor connects wallet
  ‚Üí Check auth.getUser()
  ‚Üí No user found? Store in localStorage ONLY
  ‚Üí Success! No database, no auth
```

### Authenticated User Flow
```
Public User connects wallet
  ‚Üí Check auth.getUser()
  ‚Üí User found? Full verification flow
  ‚Üí Request nonce from API
  ‚Üí Sign with wallet
  ‚Üí Verify signature
  ‚Üí Store in database
```

## Smart Upgrade Triggers

Visitors are prompted to create a Public User account at strategic moments:

### 1. Multiple Wallets (Priority 1)
- **Trigger**: User connects 3+ wallets
- **Message**: "Managing Multiple Wallets? Save your portfolio permanently with a free account"
- **Why**: User is invested enough to track multiple addresses
- **CTA**: "Create Account (No Email Required)"

### 2. Extended Session (Priority 2)
- **Trigger**: User active for 5+ minutes
- **Message**: "Still Exploring? Create an account to save your progress and data"
- **Why**: Engaged user spending significant time
- **CTA**: "Save My Portfolio"

### 3. Return Visit (Priority 3)
- **Trigger**: User returns 2+ times
- **Message**: "Welcome Back! Save your wallets so you don't have to re-add them"
- **Why**: Repeat visitor showing loyalty
- **CTA**: "Create Free Account"

### 4. Significant Portfolio (Priority 4)
- **Trigger**: Portfolio value ‚â• $100
- **Message**: "Significant Portfolio Detected. Protect your data with a permanent account"
- **Why**: User has valuable assets worth protecting
- **CTA**: "Secure My Portfolio"

## Upgrade Rules Implementation

### Location
- `utils/visitor-upgrade-rules.ts` - Core logic
- `components/nudges/SmartUpgradePrompt.tsx` - UI component
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Integration

### Key Functions

```typescript
// Check which rule should trigger
const rule = checkUpgradeTriggers();

// Dismiss a specific prompt
dismissUpgradePrompt('multiple_wallets');

// Update portfolio value for trigger
updatePortfolioValue(totalValueUsd);
```

### localStorage Keys
- `visitor_addresses` - Array of wallet objects
- `visitor_session_start` - Timestamp of first visit
- `visit_count` - Number of visits
- `portfolio_value_usd` - Total portfolio value
- `upgrade_dismissed` - Object of dismissed prompts

---

## Benefits of This Approach

### ‚úÖ Visitor-Friendly
- No friction to start
- Explore freely without signup
- No annoying exit-intent popups

### ‚úÖ Smart Conversion
- Prompt at meaningful moments
- User sees value before committing
- Multiple natural upgrade opportunities

### ‚úÖ No Database Overhead
- Visitors don't hit the database
- Scales better (fewer DB calls)
- No auth user clutter

### ‚úÖ Clear User Tiers
- Clean separation of concerns
- Each tier has clear requirements
- Easy to maintain and extend

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additional Triggers
- First feature access attempt (liquidity, trading)
- Watchlist creation
- Custom alert setup
- Export data request

### Wallet-Bootstrap Simplification
When visitor upgrades, we could offer:
1. **Email + Password** (traditional)
2. **Wallet-Only** (no email, just sign with wallet)
   - Create anonymous auth user at THIS point
   - Link wallet with signature
   - Optional: Add email later in settings

---

## Migration Path

If visitor wants to upgrade:

1. **Click upgrade CTA** ‚Üí `/sign-up`
2. **Choose method**:
   - Email/password signup
   - OR wallet-bootstrap (connect wallet to create account)
3. **Import localStorage data**:
   - Read `visitor_addresses`
   - Prompt: "Import your existing wallets?"
   - Copy to database
   - Clear localStorage

This ensures seamless transition without data loss.

## Testing

### Visitor Flow
1. Open in incognito
2. Connect 3 wallets
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. See "Multiple Wallets" prompt
5. Check localStorage for data

### Public User Flow
1. Sign up with email
2. Connect wallet
3. Should ask for signature
4. Verify in database

### Dismiss Logic
1. Click "Maybe later"
2. Reload page
3. Should NOT see same prompt
4. Check `upgrade_dismissed` in localStorage

---

## Technical Notes

- Triggers checked every 30 seconds
- Only highest priority trigger shows at once
- Dismissed prompts won't re-trigger
- Portfolio value updates on every balance fetch
- Visit count increments on page load
